is video mai aaj mai share kro ga apna expireince or mistakes i did As a software developer , 90% beginerrs yeh mistake krty hai or aksar unko realize hota hai after 1,2 year of exp
toh agr aap beginner or mid-level software developer hai , this video is for you, toh aaj mai is video mai discuss kro ga  5 aisi valuable insight jo aapko help kre gy through out software development journey.
through out my career , mane km kara hai diverce projects mai, collaborate with talented developers and faced challenges, her experiencesse mai mane seekha hai valueble lessons that i am excited to share with you today.

1. Selected a tech but didn't complete it
When I started my journey as a software developer , 
toh mane programing language or tech choose krne mai mistake kri thi, jo bh mane programming language or tech choose kri the but I didn't complete my learning process.mai always excited hota tha new technologies k baare mai, jo k her begineer krta hai
and dusi tech mai jump marna without truly mastery any of them.
AS a result, mere ps shallow knowledge thi or kisi bh area mai expertise nhi th.
Toh hamesha ek he wqt p ek stack choose kre us p jb confident then you can choose another tech.

1. Research and Choose Wisely 
2. Set Clear Goals
3. Avoid Distractions:

2. Feeling like I learned a lot:
jab koi language yah tech learn krty ho toh as a beginner yeh feel hota hai mujhe sb aataw i learn't a lots of things but it's not true, i experiencesd a phase jaha mujhe yeh feel hota tha k i new everything 
toh khud test krne k liye aap Constantly Learn, Participate in Coding Challenge or Contribute to Open Source Projects is se aapka level ptaw chaly ga. there is always more to learn 

3. I didn't focus on problem-solving
one of the critical mistakes I made k problem solving skills p focus nah krna just learning new technologies per jab as a beginner aap problem solving improve krty hai toh yeh long term help krti hai
IS mistake ko overcome krne k liye mane problem solving skills improve kra like Practice Algorithms and Data Structures,Break Down Problems,Personal Projects with Real-Life Applications

4. I just completed YouTube tutorial but didn't use my own think
When I was a beginner -  toh hamesha depend rehta tha youtube tutorials p, Now don't get me wrong, youtube tutorial helpfull hoty hai jab aap learn krty ho new skill or concept, per ek 
poin aataw hai jab aapko realize hota hai k mai fully utilize ni kr paa raha my own thinking or creativity learning process mai. 

toh  hamesha try yourself jo aap problem solve kre gy  vo puri life ni bhoole gy  lkn agr aap follow kre gy youtube tutorials toh is se aap koi bh cheez fast learn ni kr paahy gy
agr mai advice do toh after learning basics from youtube prefer documentations.

Believing that technical skills are more important than soft skills
Believing that technical skills are more important than soft skills" is a common misconception among developers, 
no doubt technical skills is essential ek software developer k liye, per soft skills ek crucial role play karta hai aap k success career growth,

(In my early days as a software developer) shuro k dino mai as a software developer mujhe feel hota tha ek technicals skills ek aisi key hai jis se mujhe
industury mai success mily gy, mera focus tha learning , programing languages, frameworks, and tools per mane nazr andaaz kr diya soft skills ko
jaise he mai bharty gaya or learn krta gya toh mujhe realized hwa k technical expertise kaafi nahi hai in the software industry.

these are the technical skills i learned ..
Communication Skills
Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
Collaboration and Teamwork
Time Management
Continuous Learning
